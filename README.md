# ðŸŽ‰ Knoetic full stack test

Welcome and congratulations to this round of our full stack coding test. Both **Backend and Frontend** expertise will be tested with an emphasis on the Frontend, particularly **state management** and **Component structure**.

---

### Grading

You will be graded based on the following:

- Code quality
- Strong understanding and application of Software Engineering principles
- Collaboration & communication skills

Our ultimate goal is to access how you work day to day, so apply the same seriousness and processes that you would in a real work environment.

---

## Set up instructions

The full stack test is powered by Node (18.17.0) & Yarn (1.22.19), but fret not if your local versions of these libraries are not compatible. This project is dockerized.

**Hot reloading is also set up**. Once the app is running, any saved changes will recompile the app.

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Building the project

```
docker-compose build
```

#### Running the project

```
docker-compose up
```

## The test (useful info)

- Google is allowed
- You are allowed to use any libraries you want
- A Trello board will be sent at the start of the test containing our tasks for the session

#### Frontend

- Frontend runs at **port 3000**
- A React application created by create-react-app (not ejected)
- Components are set up with [AntD design](https://ant.design/)

#### Backend

- Backend runs at **port 8000**
- Runs using the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework. It's ok if you are unfamiliar with the framework.
